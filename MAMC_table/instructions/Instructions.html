       The experiment today is broken into two parts where the first part will comprise of 40 rounds and second part is a survey. These are the instructions for Part 1 of the experiment. <br></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify"> This is an experiment on decision-making. In each of 40 periods, you will be asked to choose one from among 5 options which will be displayed row wise. You will have 15 seconds to make this decision in each period. Each option is described by 5 attributes which will be displayed in the columns. However, these attributes are hidden. You will have to click on these attributes to know the value. The value of each option is the result of the addition of these attributes and is measured in Experimental Currency Units (or ECU). The exchange rate will be as follows: 100 ECU = $1. While you might use a calculator, please note that you will have a very limited time to make your choices. </p>
      <p>
       In each round, you will see a screen that looks like the one below:
      </p>
<div style ="text-align: center;">
<img size="10" ,class="display", src="{{ static 'Picture1.png' }}"></img>
</div>

      <p style="text-align: justify"> You will have to click on each attribute to reveal their values. There will be a practice round after the instructions to get you familiarized with the set-up. Notice that Option A is accompanied by 5 numbers (shown by the Roman numbers I, II, III, IV, V) in a grid to its right. The value of Option A is simply the result of adding the numbers in its corresponding row. The values of Options 2-5 can be calculated in a similar way. Your goal in every round is to select the option with the highest value.
