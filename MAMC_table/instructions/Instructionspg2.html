      Before explaining more about this experiment, here is a concept you require to know for this experiment.  </p>
         <p align="left"><br><b>
             Normal Distribution
    </b></p>
    <p>
       The experiment today is broken into two parts where the first part will comprise 40 rounds and second part is a survey. These are the instructions for Part 1 of the experiment. <br></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify"> Normal distribution is a way to describe how things are spread out, like the heights of people or the weights of clementines in a basket. It looks like a bell-shaped curve when you plot it on a graph. </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify">
       Imagine you have a group of people who are all the same age. If you were to measure the height of each person and plot it on a graph, you would get a normal distribution. Most people would be of average height, with some people being taller and some people being shorter. The curve of the graph would be highest at the average height and would slope down towards the shorter and taller heights.

      <p style="text-align: justify"> In a normal distribution, the mean is the average value of all the data points. It's like finding the balance point on a seesaw - if you add up all the values and divide by the number of values, you get the mean. The variance, on the other hand, measures how spread out the data is. It's like looking at how far each data point is from the mean.
      </p>

      <p style ="text-align: justify"> So, if a normal distribution has a high variance, it means that the data points are spread out over a wide range, with some values being much higher or lower than the average. If the variance is low, it means that the data points are clustered closely around the mean, with fewer outliers. In the following figure, the blue distribution has a lower variance (40) than the red distribution which has a variance of 60. However, notice that both the distributions have the same mean of approximately 170. </p>
