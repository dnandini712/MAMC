       In each round, you will see a screen that looks like the one below.  There will be a practice round after the instructions to get you familiarized with the set-up.

      <p style="text-align: justify"> You will have to click on each attribute to reveal their values. Notice that Option A is accompanied by 5 numbers (shown by the Roman numbers I, II, III, IV, V) in a grid to its right. The value of Option A is simply the result of adding the numbers in its corresponding row. The values of Options B-E can be calculated in a similar way. Your goal in every round is to select the option with the highest value.
