      <p style ="text-align: justify"> So, if a normal distribution has a high variance, it means that the data points are spread out over a wide range, with some values being much higher or lower than the average. If the variance is low, it means that the data points are clustered closely around the mean, with fewer outliers. In the following figure, the blue distribution has a lower variance (40) than the red distribution which has a variance of 60. However, notice that both the distributions have the same mean of approximately 170. </p>
